#### Normal mode ‚ùÑÔ∏è

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his **ROUND** score.
- **BUT**, if the player rolls a 1, all his **ROUND** score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his **ROUND** score gets added to his **GLOBAL** score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on **GLOBAL** score wins the game.

#### On Fire mode üî• (ACTIVE)

- A player looses his **ENTIRE** score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn. 
- Players can set the winning score, so they can change the predefined score of 100. 
- There are two dices now. The player looses his **CURRENT** score when one of them is a 1.
